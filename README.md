## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/sparrowcode/swift-ethereum.git", .branchItem("main"))
]
```

## Account

### Create new account

In order to create a new account you have to use AccountManager. It secures your private key with AES encryption. You can also select a storage, where to hold the encrypted data.

```swift
let storage = UserDefaultsStorage(password: "password")
        
let accountManager = AccountManager(storage: storage)
        
let account = try accountManager.importAccount(privateKey: "your_private_key")
```

All the fields of your account are decoded from your private key by the library, so after importing your account you can just tap to them:

```swift
let address = account.address
let publicKey = account.publicKey
let privateKey = account.privateKey
```

### Sign data

You can sign any instance of a type that confirms to `RLPEncodable` with your private key:

```swift
let signedData = try account.sign(rlpEncodable)
```

To confirm your type to `RLPEncodable` protocol provide how the data should be encoded for your type in `encodeRLP()` method:

```swift
struct SomeType {
    let name: String
}

extension SomeType: RLPEncodable {
    func encodeRLP() throws -> Data {
        return try RLPEncoder.encode(self.name)
    }
}
```

Read more about RLP here: [RLP Ethereum Wiki](https://eth.wiki/fundamentals/rlp)

## Interacting with Ethereum

The abstraction between you and Ethereum is EthereumService. By default it is set to the mainnet, but you can easily change it by setting new `Provider` with `Node` of your choice:

```swift
EthereumService.provider = Provider(node: .ropsten)
```

You can also provide your own rpc url to Node:

```swift
let url = "http_rpc_url"

let node = try Node(url: url)
```

#### To send a transaction:

```swift
let value = "1000000000000000000" // 1 eth in wei
let transaction = try Transaction(from:"0xE92A146f86fEda6D14Ee1dc1BfB620D3F3d1b873",
                                  gasLimit: "210000",
                                  gasPrice: "250000000000",
                                  to: "0xc8DE4C1B4f6F6659944160DaC46B29a330C432B2",
                                  value: BigUInt(value))

let transactionHash = try await EthereumService.sendRawTransaction(account: account, transaction: transaction)
```

#### To call a transaction:

```swift
let transaction = try Transaction(to: "0xF65FF945f3a6067D0742fD6890f32A6960dD817d", input: "0x")

let response = try await EthereumService.call(transaction: transaction, block: "latest")
```

Quick note: block is optional for calling this methods and is set to latest by default

#### To get balance of any address:

```swift
let balance = try await EthereumService.getBalance(for: "address")
```

let gasPrice = try await EthereumService.gasPrice()
```

#### To get block transaction count by block hash:

```swift
let blockTransactionCount = try await EthereumService.getBlockTransactionCountByHash(blockHash: "block_hash")
```

#### To get block transaction count by block number:

```swift
let blockNumber = 2
let blockTransactionCount = try await EthereumService.getBlockTransactionCountByNumber(blockNumber: blockNumber)
```

#### To get storage at address:

```swift
let address = "0x295a70b2de5e3953354a6a8344e616ed314d7251"
let storageSlot = 3

let storage = try await EthereumService.getStorageAt(address: address, storageSlot: storageSlot, block: "latest")
```

#### To get code for address:

```swift
let address = "0x2b591e99afE9f32eAA6214f7B7629768c40Eeb39"

let code = try await EthereumService.getCode(address: address, block: "latest")
```

#### To get block by hash:

```swift 
let block = try await EthereumService.getBlockByHash(hash: "block_hash")
```

#### To get block by number:

```swift
let blockNumber = 12312

let block = try await EthereumService.getBlockByNumber(blockNumber: blockNumber)
```

#### To get transaction by hash:

```swift
let transactionHash = "transaction_hash"

let transaction = try await EthereumService.getTransactionByHash(transactionHash: transactionHash)
```

#### To get uncle by block hash and index:

```swift
let blockHash = "block_hash"
let index = 0

let uncleBlock = try await EthereumService.getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex(blockHash: blockHash, index: index)
```

let privateKey = "private_key"

let publicKey = try Utils.getPublicKey(from: privateKey)
```

#### To get address from public key:

```swift
let publicKey = "public_key"

let ethereumAddress = try Utils.getEthereumAddress(from: publicKey)
```

#### To get eth from wei:

```swift
let wei = "12345678901234567890"
let eth = Utils.ethFromWei(wei)
```

## Smart Contracts and ABI Decoding/Encoding

We decided to create a transaction based flow for interacting with smart contracts, because of scalable architecture and lack of strong relations

The flow is super easy, we provide factory for both ERC20 and ERC721 contracts. Factory lets you generate transactions and then you can call or send them with EthereumService

#### To get balance of an address for any ERC20 token:

```swift
let contractAddress = "token_address" 
let address = "address_to_check_balance"

let transaction = try ERC20TransactionFactory.generateBalanceTransaction(address: address, contractAddress: contractAddress)
```

#### Calling ERC20 transaction and decoding response:

Then just call the transaction with EthereumService, get the abi encoded result and decode it using ABIDecoder:

```swift
let abiEncodedBalance = try await EthereumService.call(transaction: transaction)

let balance = try ABIDecoder.decode(abiEncodedBalance, to: .uint()) as? BigUInt
```

If the abi encoded result contains several types, provide them as an array:

```swift
let decodedResult = try ABIDecoder.decode(someEncodedValue, to: [.uint(), .string, .address])
```

Decode method accepts both Data and String values

#### To encode parameters:

```swift
let params = [SmartContractParam(type: .address,  value: ABIEthereumAddress(to)),
              SmartContractParam(type: .uint(), value: value)]
        
let method = SmartContractMethod(name: "method_name", params: params)

guard let data = method.abiData else {
    return
}
```
